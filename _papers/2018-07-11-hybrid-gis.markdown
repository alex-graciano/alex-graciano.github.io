Several geospatial problems like urban subsurface analysis involve
data from multiple domains and nature such as three-dimensional
vector layers or volumetric models of geological structures. This
requires the definition of hybrid schemes and algorithms that keep
the dimensionality and domain of the data, while allowing the
joint management of both representations in a combined way. In
addition, a proper 3D visualization method that shows those heterogeneous data together can be very useful for geoscientific and
GIS professionals. In this paper, we present the foundations of a
real-time 3D visualization framework capable of rendering field
and vector data, as well as a set of operations that can solve many
problems for engaging data from different domains. We propose
the use of the Stack-Based Representation of Terrains for field data
which provides a whole 3D representation of volumetric terrains
while allowing an efficient memory usage. The resulting hybrid
framework can help geoscientists and engineers to analyze 3D
complex geospatial data and make decisions at a glance
